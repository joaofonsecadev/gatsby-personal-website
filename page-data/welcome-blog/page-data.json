In previous iterations, it has been a simple WordPress website where I showcased my below-average photos. This time around, I decided that I wanted to make everything from scratch instead of relying on a clunky content manager. With this approach, I'm not only in full control of my website (for better or worse), but I can also keep my web development skills from getting rusty.</p>\n<p>As my friends know, my design skills do not exist. That's why I took inspiration (which is programmer-speak to say copy pasted) from <a href=\"https://www.taniarascia.com/\">the wonderful design Tania has made on her website</a>. It was only possible due to Tania's website being open source, which is why I think it's only fair for me to pay the favour forward. To honour the \"open source pact\", all the source code for this website is available on <a href=\"https://github.com/joaofonsecadev\">my Github</a>.</p>\n<p>Don't be mistaken though, the website is far from being done. There are still a lot of improvements I want to make. Some of them are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Proper SEO</li>\n<li>Custom icons</li>\n<li>Images in articles</li>\n<li>RSS feed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And this concludes this short introduction to my blog. Thank you for taking the time to read this first article, and I promise that when you come back there will be more content!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Welcome to my blog!","description":null,"slug":"/welcome-blog","tags":["meta"],"date":"June 01, 2022"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/welcome-blog","prev":null,"next":{"id":"e1eebaa7-8ad5-5f25-a2e8-256fb5693590","frontmatter":{"title":"Contributing to open-source projects on Github","tags":["open-source","git"],"slug":"/contribute-open-source-github","type":"article"}}}},
