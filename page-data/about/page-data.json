I'm a game developer born and raised in Lisbon, Portugal, and welcome to my space on the web.</p>\n<p>I've always been a gamer, my earliest memories being with a Playstation 2 and my cousin's Game Boy Color. I honestly can't remember a time when I did not have a video game to play, even if it was on an old computer with a CRT monitor. When I learned about the concept of a \"dream job\", and that I had to work if I wanted to have a nice life, I decided it would be making games (and archaeology but let's ignore that for now).</p>\n<p>Instead of studying what I was supposed to during school, I spent my time copy-pasting JavaScript into Unity, back when it was supported. That eventually led me to the path of programming which led me to where I am now: a part-time game developer and full-time procrastinator.</p>\n<p>Here you'll find tutorials, projects, photos, my opinions and whatever else I feel like writing about. My goal with this website is to share what I learn with everyone, even if there's not much to learn from here.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-im-doing-now\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#what-im-doing-now\" aria-label=\"what im doing now permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What I'm doing now</h3>\n<p><em>Updated May 29, 2022</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Working full-time on the open world survival Dune game with Funcom</li>\n<li>Building (trying to build) my own game engine</li>\n<li>Grinding CSGO until I'm Global Elite</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"socials\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#socials\" aria-label=\"socials permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Socials</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/joaofonsecadev\">Github</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/joaofonsecadev\">Twitter</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"/resume\">Resume</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"About","description":"Part-time game developer, full-time procrastinator.","slug":"/about"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/about"}},
